description: "\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" or \"A Dead Man's Dream\" is a\
  \ short story by American author Ambrose Bierce. Originally published by The San\
  \ Francisco Examiner on July 13, 1890, it was first collected in Bierce's 1891 book\
  \ Tales of Soldiers and Civilians. The story, which is set during the Civil War,\
  \ is famous for its irregular time sequence and twist ending. Bierce's abandonment\
  \ of strict linear narration in favor of the internal mind of the protagonist is\
  \ considered an early example of experimentation with stream of consciousness. It\
  \ is Bierce's most anthologized story.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
